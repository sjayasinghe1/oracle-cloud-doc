Considering retail domain in South Asian region which mainly involves with the majority of the daily lives of the people in the particular region. Because most of the people are not white collars compared to Western regions in other parts of the world. With regard to being the buyer as well as the seller and other related tasks for the same are usually done by same group of people. In developed countries most of the tasks are automated and minimum to no involvement of the people to the retail domain. This is the exact model or the modern best practices that this region requires to be implemented. This can be achieved by simple bring the technology in to action.
As per the objectives which needs to be achieved by states, practices modern best practices based on international relations and imposed regulations from the organizations operates in the region as it can be easily distributed among region as low-cost ERP systems are available from best vendors from the world. Oracle Applications are best suit to any type of domain where it customizable to retail even.
Proposed solution is the architecture of Service Orientation where commonly used and easy to implement with minimum knowledge of Software Engineering. Integration architecture implemented in Oracle Application Express (APEX) where core SCM to Financial system uses Oracle E Business Suit. Once it is in operation DevOps road map has been in place for to minimize manual support tasks. Going forward new trends such as Artificial Intelligence can be easily adopted because the DevOps road map expandable in this solution as Oracle Applications are capable of.
There were range of solutions but most effective solution was to use a currently successfully running Point of Sales product integrating to Oracle SCM and Financial modules where most of the Sri Lankan market of Oracle Consultants are SCM and Finance qualified and experience in the same compared to implement the Oracle retail module which is not that much common in the region and cost-wise and other tasks wise feasible recommended by Oracle reginal experts. Other solutions were e-Wis Point of Sales system integrating to Oracle Application using file based approach. This is a straightforward approach but traditional for the current automation disruption era a.k.a. Industry 4.0 where less expandable to automations compared to chosen solution. Main factors considered were resources, cost and popularity. But there can be other factors like robustness for the importance of transactions, transparency as it has to be internationally recognized, and scalability for next era, deprecating traditional approaches to use latest technologies comply with for the ease of support and maintenance can be mainly highlighted. Selecting this solution based not only the suitability but also the previous technical expertise related to core functionalities in areas of wide knowledge of APIs and type of integrations\gateways available in Oracle Business Suit. Meantime the academics are highly assessed make the decision of voting on this solution. Taking about the rationale new technologies like SOA leads traditional approaches because high rate of improvements to the technology is released by the proprietary owners as it is highly growing and more attention of the open source community to other funding organizations’ investments. The challenges faces includes:
•	deprecating of the previous APIs
•	compatibility of the technology releases to the Oracle E Business Suit patches
•	align the data models to process models adhering the formats such as JSON with respect to REST APIs
•	data transfer security as it uses HTTP with SSL which can be easily breakdown compared to specific sockets programs
•	network failures and identify those as it is occurred
•	volume of data load that can be transferred without any corruptions and easily recovered using ERP system functionality

In order to overcome above challenges most effective approach is using Oracle Fusion Cloud applications and tolls where full-edged and which available with more functionalities that are easy to adopt and use in the support and maintenance. Considering the scale of the project and technical and non-technical factors used to make the decision of this implementation of Information System, free and open source tools used. 
•	Oracle Apiray for documentation and API management
•	Running Microsoft Team Foundation Server testing machines\engines with new test cases and practice a good continuous improvements and continuous delivery using build and release tools available
•	Oracle APEX REST API definition and mapping tool options available in APEX online IDE
•	Network interfaces such as firewall, Windows Server interface
•	Oracle Database level PL\SQL code structures to handle data corruptions and recover them
