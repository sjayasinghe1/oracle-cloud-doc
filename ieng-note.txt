explain the rationale and justify its options
challenges and how overcome

- Analysis/Design/Development/Implementation technique - BP\RD\USER GUIDE\MD\CV
- The methods for validating the work; how you validated within the time constraints and any constraints on available resources “Did the product meet its objectives?” - TESTING
- A disciplined approach to implementation (from applying techniques, to doing the work – building, testing, refining – according to the plan) - TFS\Github\Codacy\SWAGGERHUB\apiary
